## Features
### Passkey Support
Passkey is WebAuthn-based flow which replaces the traditional combination of "password + second-factor" authentication method.
Using AuthC's built-in webforms users can now register and login into your application without a password. 

Passkeys are resistant to push-phishing, are unique across every website, and are generated using cryptographically secure hardware (like a mobile device).

Additionally, passkeys generated by the three main platform authenticator vendors (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) are automatically synchronized across a user's devices by their respective cloud account. That means there's finally an easy way for users to regain account access if they happen to lose or trade in their device.
